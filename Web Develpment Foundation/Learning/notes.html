    <title>Some notes about HTML</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>This is My HTML notes</p>
    <p>************* 4:- The job of HTML *************</p>
    <p>HTML = HyperText Markup Language</p>

    <p>HTML is consists of</p>
    <p>1-text that you read in your browser</p>
    <p>
      2- markup which tell the browser what that text should look like or how
      it's arranged
    </p>
    <p>
      3- htere can be refrences to other documents and files like images and
      videos
    </p>

    <p>************ 5:- Markup ****************</p>
    <p>Markup :- is just a text that has a special meaning to the browser</p>

    <strong>bold</strong>
    <p>this code above make the word between the tags bold</p>

    <em>italic</em>
    <p>this code above make the word between the tags italic</p>

    <p>
      the first tag is called the openning tag and the last is called the
      closing tag
    </p>

    <p>the bigger than and smaller than sympols is called angle brackets</p>

    <p>*************** 6:- white spaces **************</p>
    <p>
      when the browser run the html code it collapse all the white spaces in a
      single white space
    </p>

    <p>what a white space means?</p>
    <p>
      developers use the term white spaces to descripe spaces, tabs and line
      breaks
    </p>

    <br />
    <p>it's a tag thet stands for break</p>
    <p>it's used to break the line in other meaning it makes a new line</p>

    <p>
      This tag doesn't have a closing tag so it's called (Void Elements, Empty
      Elements)
    </p>
    <p>
      this type of elemnts doesn't need any closing tag or it's a self closing
      tag
    </p>
    <p>eg:- <img src="" alt="some photo" /></p>

    <p>*************** 7:- paragraphes ***************</p>

    <p>to mke a paragraph we use the (p) element</p>
    <p>
      when we want to write some thing we use it not the <br />
      tag
    </p>
    <p>
      we use it beacause we can add classes to it and style it later on with
      classes
    </p>
    <>
    <p>This words inside a paragraph tag</p>

    <p>*************** 8:-lots of elements **************</p>
    <mark>Highlighted word</mark>
    <p>the mark tag is highlighting the text wrapped betwwen it</p>
    <sup>some Word</sup>
    <p>it make the word above as an exponent<sup>superscript</sup></p>
    <sup>some word</sup>
    <p>
      it make the word down as a some chemical material formula<sub
        >subscript</sub
      >
    </p>

    <p>************* 9:- nested elements **************</p>
    <p>
      this means that some html elements can go inside some other html element
      but they have to stick with some rules
    </p>
    <p>some <em>important</em> words</p>
    <p>we can't do this mistakes</p>
    <!--
<p>there is <p>some words</p> that i have to say</p>
<em>we can't <sub>DO </em> this</sub>
-->

    <p>************ 10:- Heading **************</p>

    <p>headings are used for headlines or section headings</p>
    <p>there are 6 level of heading frpm (h1) to (h6)></p>
    <p>
      (h1) is used for the main heading on a page and while you are going down
      in the levels of heading you use smaller heading
    </p>

    <h1>Animal</h1>
    <h2>cat</h2>
    <h3>cat diet</h3>
    <h2>dogs</h2>
    <h3>dogs diet</h3>
    <br /><br />
    <h1>My HTML Notes</h1>
    <p>This page is a collection of my awesome notes about HTML!</p>
    <h2>The Web</h2>
    <p>
      The Web (or World Wide Web) is a collection of documents and other files.
      Most of the documents are made using Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)
    </p>
    <h2>What is HTML?</h2>
    <p>
      HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. It's used to define the
      structure or layout of a web page
    </p>
    <br /><br />
    <h1>My Chemistry Notes</h1>
    <p><strong>Molecule name:</strong> <em>Sulfur hexafluoride</em></p>
    <p><strong>Molecular formula:</strong> SF<sub>6</sub></p>
    <br />
    <p>
      <strong>Note:</strong> This has a much higher denisty than air. BAsically
      the opposite of helium <mark>Crazy!</mark>
    </p>

    <p>*********** 11:- block and inline ***************</p>
    <p>
      the difference between br a p elements that br just break the line not any
      thing else but the p tag contain the paragraphs and make a block around
      them
    </p>
    <p>this block has a height and a widtth and also has a margin below it</p>
    <p>
      there are a lot of elements that do that an dthese elements called block
      elements
    </p>
    <p>
      and the elements that don't create that block around called inline
      elements
    </p>
    <h3><mark>some of the block elements</mark></h3>
    <p>ul and ol for lists</p>
    <p>h1 : h6 for headings</p>
    <p>video for video player</p>
    <p>div for a generic block</p>
    <p>table for table</p>
    <br />
    <h3><mark>some of the inline elements</mark></h3>
    <p>br for breaking the line</p>
    <p>em and strong for emphasis</p>
    <p>mark for highlighting</p>
    <p>a for hyper text link</p>
    <p>img for imsge</p>
    <p>span for generic inline</p>

    <p>*********** 11:- divs ***************</p>
    <div>
      The div is short for division, because that's what this element is for—you
      can use it to divide up the page into different sections.
    </div>

    <p>
      Like the paragraph p element, the division div element has an invisible
      box around it—and just like p, it can have a border, a margin, a width, a
      height, and so on.
    </p>
    <p>
      But a p element is specifically meant to contain text. In contrast, the
      div element is a generic container for whatever other elements you might
      want to put inside. You can use the div element to organize the content
      and divide the page into sections.
    </p>
    <br />
    <div>
      <p>call me ishmael</p>
      <p>just don't call me late for dinner</p>
    </div>
    <br />
    <p>
      The div element is a super important one, and it's used a lot in HTML to
      help lay out and organize pages. We aren't going to use the div element
      much in this lesson, but we'll be coming back to it in the next lesson—so
      keep it in mind!
    </p>

    <p>************** 12- lists and implied close tags *************</p>
    <ul></ul>
    <p>is the tag for unordered list</p>
    <ol></ol>
    <p>is the tag for ordered list</p>
    <li></li>
    <p>is the tag to create a list item</p>
    <p>
      you can use an unordered list inside a list item inside an ordered list
    </p>
    <p>
      you can't use a list item inside a list item and because of that you can
      skip writing the closing tag of the list item element
    </p>
    <p>
      the oredered list element end the unordered list item you have to write
      the closing tag of them
    </p>

    <p>
      The p element is another example of an element for which the closing tag
      is optional.
    </p>

    <p>
      when you leave off an optional closing tag, it is still implied—that is,
      the browser will figure out where the element should be closed, even
      though you didn't explicitly tell it.
    </p>

        </ol>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <br />

    <p>************** 14:- Indentation **************</p>
    <p>
      Indentation in HTML is not a must and it will not affect the result of the
      code but it makes the code muh more prettier
    </p>
    <br />

    <p>************* 15:-Web Addresses **************</p>
    <p>in the web world these addresses have a technical name which is URL</p>
    <p>URL stands for Uniform Resource Locater</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>UNIFORM</strong> = standrized</li>
      <li><strong>RESOURCE</strong> = a file or other data object</li>
      <li><strong>LOCATOR</strong> = address for finding something</li>
    </ul>
    <p>you can write a url like this three examples</p>
    <p>www.somecompany.com</p>
    <p>http://.somecompany.com</p>
    <p>https://.somecompany.com</p>

    <p>the first example don't work in HTML only the last two</p>

    <a href="https://www.exmple.com"></a>
    <p>
      this is an anchor tag has a href of a <strong>fully qualified URL</strong>
    </p>

    <p>http ,https and file are called protocols</p>
    <p>Protocols means a way for a browser to get something</p>
    <p>A URL consists of (protocol://DomainName/filePath</p>
    <p>
      if you leave the file path empty you will go to the home page of the
      website
    </p>
    <br />

    <p>************** 16:- links and anchor tag ***********</p>
    <p>the web is build on the idea of hypertext</p>
    <p>
      it means that you can get text content but also you can get some refrences
      between them and this is called links
    </p>
    <p>
      when you click on a link it redirect you somewhere else regardless it's
      yours or someone's else
    </p>

    <a href="#"
      >this is the element to create a link in HTML and it stands for anchor</a
    >
    <p>
      to make an a element you have to write its destination or the url which
      the link will go to and you can write this url in the (href) attripute
    </p>
    <p>
      An HtML Attribute is an extra peice of data that is added to the element
      which provide extra information to the element or some instruction
    </p>
    <p>the attribute consists of (name = "value of the attribute")</p>
    <p>
      in the anchor tag the attribute we use is called href and this stands for
      hypertext refrence
    </p>
    <p>the a tag is an inline element</p>
    <p>
      It doesn't create a box on the page. Links normally have the appearance of
      a specially highlighted piece of text.
    </p>

    <a href="https://www.yputube.com">this is my favourite website</a>

    <p>
      in the webpage if you click on the link it will redirect the page you are
      currently in to other website or other page
    </p>
    <p>
      to avoid that you can use the target attribute which has the value of
      _blank to make the link open in a new tab
    </p>
    <br />

    <p>************* 17:-Adding Images *************</p>

    <p>the img element is the element we use to add an image to the webpage</p>
    <img src="https://placebear.com/250/250" alt="some alternative text" />
    <p>the img element is a void or an empty element</p>
    <p>
      it consists of the openening tag an two attributes the source attribute
      (src) and the alternative text attribute (alt)
    </p>
    <br />

    <p>************* 18:- Files and relative URLs *************</p>
    <p>
      if you want to put an image in yor website you have to put the link of in
      the src attribute
    </p>
    <p>what if the image source is on my pc</p>
    <p>
      then you just put the file path of the image on your pc in the src tag or
      for short you can use the relative url
    </p>

    <br />

    <p>My favourite things:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bear">Bears</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kitten">Kittens</a></li>
    </ol>
    <img src="https://placebear.com/150/150" alt="some bear photo" />
    <img src="https://placekitten.com/150/150" alt="some kitten photo" />
    <br />

    <p>************* 19:- Documents: The DOCTYPE Tag *************</p>
    <p>
      the doctype tag is a tag that tells the browser the version of the html
      you are using right now
    </p>
    <p>
      you have to write that tag in each single html page to be a complete one
    </p>
    <p>that its syntax</p>
    <!-- <!DOCTYPE html> -->
    <br />

    <p>************* 20:- Document: Head and Body *************</p>

    <p>a full html page has 2 parts</p>
    <p>
      every thing you see in the screen lives in the seconed part and this part
      is called the body
    </p>
    <p>
      the first part is called the head and in it we put some crucial pieces of
      information about the document
    </p>
    <p>
      Both he head and the body lives together in a single large element called
      html
    </p>
    <p>one of the elements that is written in the head is the title element</p>
    <p>
      it's the only required element in the head and it give the browser the
      title of the page you are currently in
    </p>
    <p>
      another element in the head is called (style) and this you can put the
      styles of the elements in the body in it and the code in it's enclosing is
      written in classes
    </p>
    <p>
      the can also contain script tag which makes your web dynamic and run in
      the browser and this how frontend work
    </p>
    <p>the head also can include the meta tag which stands for meta data</p>
    <p>
      it includes some information about the page it self such as keywords for
      search engines
    </p>
    <p>
      there is also information that can be as attribtes in the html tag such as
      the language of the page (lang)
    </p>
    <p>
      Are head and body required? In one sense, no, but in another sense, yes.
      The grammar of HTML does not require that you literally write a head or
      body tag in your HTML code. Many web developers do write these. However,
      if you don't, the browser will attempt to place them into your code
      itself. It needs to put the head element around certain elements that
      belong there, such as title; and to put the body element around the
      elements that form the document's body. This means that all the head
      elements must appear first, and the body elements after. You can't have a
      head element, such as title, in the middle of your document:
    </p>
    <br />
    <h3>************ 21:-the rules of a tree structure ***************</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>a tree has a root node</li>
      <li>
        Each node can have branches that lead to other nodes (its children)
      </li>
      <li>each node has exactly one parent except the root</li>
    </ul>
    <br />

    <p>*************** 22:- from trees to boxes *************</p>
    <p>
      the html tree to be previewed on the browser and be the 2d preview that we
      know
    </p>
    <p>this preview called <mark>boxes</mark></p>
    <p>
      and the layout of the boxes is controled by the tree structure with the
      help of css
    </p>
    <p>
      you can for example style these boxes to be in any color or any
      orientation or to hide it, magnify it or minimize the size of it
    </p>
    <p><strong>all of this is done by the CSS</strong></p>
    <br />

    <p>*************** 23:- styling html directly *************</p>
    <p>
      we can style html elements directly with the style attribute like this
      <span style="color: peru">word and this is is called inline styling</span>
    </p>
    <p>but this is the bad way of styling an element for these reasons</p>
    <ul class="styled-ul">
      <li>it will be a lot of code</li>
      <li>there wil be a lot of repeatition</li>
      <li>it will be hard to catch errors</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      we can make multible inline styles to an element by judt add the styles
      one after another and seperate them with semicolon like this
      <span style="color: red; font-size: 24px; padding: 0 25px 0">word</span>
    </p>
    <br />

    <p>************ 24:- styling html seperatly**************</p>
    <p>
      to avoid inline styles we can style the html elements by writing their
      styling in the style tag in the head element like i have styled the list
      above
    </p>
    <p>this it called <strong>styling HTML seperately</strong></p>
    <br />

    <p>**************** 25:- CSS Syntax *************</p>
    <p>A CSS ruleset is made up of</p>
    <ul>
      <li>a selector</li>
      <li>a declaration block</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <strong>SELECTOR:-</strong>Selectors indicate which HTML elements the
      ruleset will apply to. For example, consider this ruleset:
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>DECLARATION BLOCK:-</strong>A declaration block describes how the
      ruleset will modify the elements. In the above example, the declaration
      block is saying that all li elements will be modified by changing their
      font colors to green.
    </p>
    <p>
      when we want to style all the p elements we write in CSS p then curly
      brackets then our style
    </p>
    <p>But what if we want to style one p element not all of them</p>
    <p>then we can use the cass attribute</p>
    <p>
      The class attribute gives the element we want to style a name to be
      recognizable and easy to reach out and styled
    </p>
    <br />

    <p>************** 26:- CSS selectors types ************</p>
    <p>there is more than one type of selectors</p>
    <ul>
      <li>type selector (element)</li>
      <li>class selector</li>
      <li>id selector</li>
    </ul>
    <p>the difference between an id and class is that idName is used for one element and you can't give to another but a className you can git it to an infinite number of elements</p>
    <p>another difference between them is in their syntax when we want to specify an id we use # before the id name but for a class name we use the .</p>
    
  </body>
</html>
